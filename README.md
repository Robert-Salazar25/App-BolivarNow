### Junior Developer | 📱 Platform: Android (Kotlin) | ⏳ Status: Beta

A currency conversion app specialized for the Venezuelan market, featuring real-time exchange rates, multiple rate monitors, and a modern interface built with Jetpack Compose.

## 🚀 Key Features
✔ Real-time conversion between USD/EUR and bolívars

✔ Support for multiple Venezuelan rate monitors

✔ Modern UI with Jetpack Compose and Material Design 3

✔ Flexible currency and monitor selection

✔ Smooth animations and visual feedback

✔ Robust error handling and loading states

✔ Manual rate updates

## 🛠 Key Technologies
- Language: Kotlin
- Architecture: MVVM
- UI: Jetpack Compose + Material Design 3
- API: Retrofit + Gson
- Async: Coroutines
- Images: Coil
- Dependency Injection: Manual (no Hilt)

## 🎯 Why This Project Stands Out in My Portfolio
### Advanced Techniques:
- REST API consumption with Retrofit
- Fully declarative UI with Jetpack Compose
- Reactive states with Flow and State Management
- Custom animations with Compose Animation
- Responsive and adaptive design

### Best Practices:
- MVVM architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Repository pattern for data abstraction
- Immutable and predictable UI states
- Proper error handling and loading states
- Reusable and modular components

## 📱 Technical Functionalities
### Navigation and UI:
- Single Activity with Jetpack Compose
- Custom dialogs for selection
- Integrated numeric keypad
- Animated transitions between states

### Data Management:
- Consumption of public exchange rate API
- Implicit caching via repository pattern
- Data transformation for UI
- Manual rate updates

### Key Components:
- CurrencyViewModel - State management and business logic
- CurrencyRepository - Data source abstraction
- CurrencyConverterUI - Main screen with composables
- Modular reusable components

## 📊 How This Project Demonstrates My Skills
- Technical Skill: Full implementation with modern Jetpack Compose
- Architecture: Clean MVVM with layered separation
- UX/UI: Intuitive design following Material Design 3
- Problem Solving: Handling complex UI states and network errors
- Code Quality: Well-structured and documented code
